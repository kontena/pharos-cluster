4.	MISCELLANEOUS

    This Agreement completely and exclusively states the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter herein, and it supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified by Kontena from time to time, and any such modifications will be effective upon the "Posted Date" set forth at the top of the modified Agreement. If any provision hereof is held unenforceable, this Agreement will continue without said provision and be interpreted to reflect the original intent of the parties. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it, is governed exclusively by laws of Finland. This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its existence and validity, shall be resolved by the courts with jurisdiction in Helsinki, Finland. The parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and defenses either might otherwise have in any such action or proceeding in any of such courts based upon any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, forum non conveniens or any similar claim or defense. A breach or threatened breach, by You of Section 1 may cause irreparable harm for which damages at law may not provide adequate relief, and therefore Kontena shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without being required to post a bond. You may not assign this Agreement (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or acquisition), in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of Kontena, which may be withheld or granted by Kontena in its sole and absolute discretion. Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void. Notices to Kontena may also be sent to legal@kontena.io.
